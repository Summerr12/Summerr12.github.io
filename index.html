        <p id="intro">Hello, my name is Benjamin Nhan, a upcoming Junior at San Francisco. I've started coding at the beginning of my sophmore year in highschool and this is my first time using css. I am excited to continue working with everyone and learning all from Mr. Malan and my classmates no matter how little sleep I get. </p>
      <p id="likes">Some of the things I like to do are:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><i>Volleyball</i></li>
          <li>Running</li>
          <li>Video games</li>
          <li>Exploring</li>
          <li>Watch anime</li>
      </ul>
      <p id="morelikes">I play for the boy's volleyball team at my highschool and used to run track for my middle school till I broke one of my knees. This is also my first time every traveling at all and even on an airplane. So everything here is new and super refreshing for me to see and experience.</p>
      <p id="Values">I recently did an activity at Harvard called Standing Out like a Boss and there was a section that asked us what we value and a gave a list of many attributes and values. Out of the <b>~40</b>, I had to choose 3 and they were</p>
      <ol>
        <li><b>Growth</b></li>
        <li>Commitment</li>
        <li>Connection</li>
        <p>I consider those values to be my morals and how I see people and their perspective. I Like to work in groups as I am more confident in others than myself. As time passes, its good to know many perspectives and how others see things so Growth is the foundation to your knowledge while Commitment is something you have to stand by and if you don't you might not beable to move anywhere.</p>
      </ol>
